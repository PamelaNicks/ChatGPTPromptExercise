Prompt: create a short poem about c# programming language
In the realm of code where the brave ones tread,
C# reigns with grace, its power widespread.
Syntax so clean, like a well-tuned song,
In the land of .NET, it belongs.

From desktop to cloud, it builds with flair,
A language robust, beyond compare.
Type-safe and strong, with LINQ in its core,
It bridges the old and the new, evermore.

With each line of code, it crafts with ease,
A world of logic thatâ€™s meant to please.
Oh, C#, thou art a coder's delight,
A beacon of clarity, in the darkest night.
